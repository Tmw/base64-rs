# Basic Base64 implementation in Rust

This repository holds the completed project accompanying the blogpost [Implementing Base64 from scratch in Rust](https://tiemenwaterreus.com/posts/implementing-base64-in-rust/). It is by no means a perfect implementation of Base64 but rather meant as a learning project. Feedback and PRs are welcomed ðŸ™‚
